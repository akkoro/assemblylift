AssemblyLift is a framework for building serverless applications powered by WebAssembly (WASM).

# Getting Started

Please see the [official documentation](https://docs.assemblylift.akkoro.io) for help with installing & learning to use AssemblyLift, and/or for more information about the project.

There is an **examples** repository [here](https://github.com/akkoro/assemblylift-examples).

# Contributing

I'd like to figure this part out collaboratively. Just in terms of getting code merged though,
I'm a big fan of [forking workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/forking-workflow),
so let's start there ðŸ™‚.
